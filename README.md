### Suggested Contributions

* Storage modal file url to clipboard - There should be some way to get the file url when storage ui is used from the full screen app. Maybe direct copy-to-clipboard via an icon pop up on hover over.

* Use proper angularjs modals for new folder and delete confirmation prompts. This application should use proper angularjs modals rather than prompts

* i18n Language Support
