*if the Project does not support Internationalization include this section and include this need in our suggested contributions*
In order to support languages i18n needs to be added to this repository.  Please refer to our Suggested Contributions.

### Suggested Contributions
* Storage modal file url to clipboard - There should be some way to get the file url when storage ui is used from the full screen app. Maybe direct copy-to-clipboard via an icon pop up on hover over.

* Use proper angularjs modals for new folder and delete confirmation prompts. This application should use proper angularjs modals rather than prompts

* i18n Language Support
